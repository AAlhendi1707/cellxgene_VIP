# How to use Cellxgene VIP

## Graphical user interface of cellxgene and VIP
The main window of cellxgene is divided into three regions, the left panel mainly displays categorial
annotations, brief description of the data set and initial graphics setting, specifically embedding and
coloring of cells. On the right panel, it hosts continuous variables, such as qc metrics shown in histogram
with x, y corresponding to values of a measurement and numbers of cells, respectively. More
importantly, cells shown as individual dots are presented in the center panel based on a selected
embedding and colored by either categorial annotations or continuous variables, which is indicated by
pressed rain drop icon.

![Cellxgene main window, functional icons and minimized VIP bar next to cellxgene logo](figures/F1A.jpg)

![VIP (Visualization in Plugin) window and controls of user interface. The cursor will change to corresponding icon when mouse hovers over control anchors inside the window. In the case of missing title bar after operation, changing the size of outside browser window (not VIP window) will always bring the VIP window back to the original location near the cellxgene logo](figures/F1B.jpg)

## Cell	selection	by	categorial	annotations

![Cell selection by categorial annotation. Selected B cells are shown in bold dots and highlighted in purple color when hovering mouse over the cluster](figures/F2.jpg)

It is an overlap operation when categories from multiple annotations are checked to make the final selection. E.g., if male from sex is also checked besides B cells, it means cells from B cells cluster of male samples are selected.
Note: Click “1:” or “2:” button to save cell selection into group 1 or 2

## Cell	selection	by brushing	on	distribution	of	continues	variables

![Cell selection by brushing the ranges of continuous variables. Low- and high-end values are shown at top corners of brushing boxes in dark gray](figures/F3.jpg)

Note: Histograms of expression values of genes can by brushed as well to get cells expressing certain genes in the range.

## Free	hand	Lasso	selection	on	dots	representing	cells
From the cell visualization panel, user can freely select a cluster of cells of interest by using ‘Lasso’ selection tool. The selected cluster of cells can also be added as a group for downstream analysis in cellxgene VIP.

![Select cells by using free hand Lasso selection tool and add these cells as a group for further analysis in cellxgene VIP](figures/F4.jpg)

Note: Please try to draw as close as possible to the starting point in the end to make an enclosed shape to ensure successfully lasso selection.

## VIP	– Figure	Option
User can set parameters for figure plotting that control plotting functions except CLI. ‘split_show’ branch of Scanpy offers better representation of Stacked Violin and Dot Plot comparing to master branch.

![Setting parameters for figure plotting](figures/F5.jpg)

Scaled data have zero mean and unit variance per gene. This was performed by calculating z-scores of the expression data using Scanpy’s scale function. (Scanpy pp.scale function: Scale data to unit variance and zero mean.) 

We provide flexibility to allow 1) scale to unit variance or not; 2) Zero centered or not; 3) Capped at max value after scaling.

We recommend using scaled data for plotting/visualization while using non-scaled data for differential gene expression analysis.

Note: Dot plot is one exception in visualization category which uses non-scaled data for meaningful interpretation. 


## VIP	– Add	Genes	/	Gene	Sets
Cellxgene VIP allows user to add any genes or gene sets for extensive exploration and visualization. User can either type a list of gene in the textbox or create sets of genes to be grouped together in plots. Then the genes will be automatically listed for plotting in other functional modules after checking availability in the dataset.

![Add gene or gene sets for plotting](figures/F6.jpg)

Note: The cursor will turn to cross icon while hovering over a gene name, then click to delete the gene.

## VIP	– Violin	Plot

To plot expression of gene among categories of an annotation, e.g., cell type, sex, or batch etc.
Step 1. User needs to select the group(s) of cells for plotting. These groups can be created by using selection tools illustrated in tutorial section 2, 3 and/or 4. Initially, all of cells are gathered in ‘Group 1’ by default.
Step 2. Select a gene from the gene list which could be added as shown in section 6. An expression level cutoff can be set to further filter out cells with low level expression of such gene.
Step 3. Select the annotation to group cells for plotting.
Step 4. Execute plotting, get plotting data (i.e., gene expression), manipulate image (e.g., zoom in/out) or save the image. 

![Violin plot of gene expression values of a gene grouped by cell type](figures/F7.jpg)
Note: Figure resolution and format can be set in “Figure Option” tab as shown in tutorial section 5.

## VIP	– Stacked	Violin
Beyond plotting expression values of a gene, stacked violin allows plotting of multiple genes together.

![Stacked Violin plot of multiple genes and/or gene set](figures/F8.jpg)

Note: If collapsing of gene sets is set to ‘Yes’, average gene expression of genes in a set is used for plotting.

## VIP	– Heatmap
To show or compare the expression level (i.e., expression value or expression Z-score) of multiple genes among the selected group of cells.

![Heatmap of gene expression in cells grouped by annotations.](figures/F9.jpg)


## VIP	– UMAP/tSNE
To plot the embedding of cells in the selected group(s). One of pre-computed and loaded embeddings  can be selected.

User can color cells in the embedding plots by multiple annotations (e.g., cell_type, diagnosis). 

Besides coloring cells by annotations, user can color cells based on gene expression level of selected genes in the embedding plots.

![Embedding plotting of expression level of genes or gene set in the cells split by categories of an annotation](figures/F10.jpg)

## VIP	– Dot	Plot
To show the fraction of cells (annotated by dot size) expressing a gene in each group and the averaged expression level of the gene (annotated by color intensity) in the group.

![Dot plotting of the fraction of cells expressing genes above a cutoff in each categorie of the selected annotation](figures/F11.jpg)

Note: The number of cells represented by side bar chart are always numbers of cells distributed in each category of certain annotation without filtering. It will give accurate estimate of number of cells in each bubble in the plot. The use of the plot is only meaningful when the counts matrix contains zeros representing no gene counts. Its visualization does not work for scaled or corrected matrices in which zero counts had been replaced by other values, see https://scanpy-tutorials.readthedocs.io/en/multiomics/visualizing-marker-genes.html#Dot-plots.

## VIP	– Track	Plot

To show the expression of gene(s) of individual cells as vertical lines grouped by the selected annotation on x-axis. Instead of a color scale, the gene expression is represented by height.

![Track plotting of expression of genes or gene set in each category of the selected annotation. Gene expression levels are represented by the heights of vertical lines](figures/F12.jpg)

## VIP	– Density	Plot

To show the density of gene(s) expression in the cells annotated by category in the selected group(s) of cells. A density plot is a representation of the distribution of a numeric variable. It uses a kernel density estimate to show the probability density function of the variable (see more). It is a smoothed version of the histogram and is used in the same concept.

The bandwidth defines how close to a value point the distance between two points must be to influence the estimation of the density at the point. A small bandwidth only considers the closest values, so the estimation is close to the data. A large bandwidth considers more points and gives a smoother estimation.

![Density plotting of the expression of genes in each group split by one annotation while colored by another.](figures/F13.jpg)

## VIP	– 2D	Density	Plot
Besides plotting of expression density of single gene, 2D density plot allows to explore the joint expression density of two genes in the cells expressing both genes above a cutoff.

![2D Density plotting of expression of two genes in the selected cells](figures/F14.jpg)

## VIP	– Dual	Genes
To view the relationship of expression levels of two genes in selected cells. It is based on the embedding plot of cells while coloring cells according to the expression levels of gene(s) in each cell.

![Embedding plotting of the expression of two genes in the selected cell group(s)](figures/F15.jpg)

## VIP	– Sankey	Diagram
Sankey diagram shows the flow of gene expression and annotations linked by cells. Gene expression is divided equally into bins so user can view distribution relationship between gene expression and annotations. 

The diagram is also shown in an interactive way that user can change the layout by selecting several items (e.g., thin or thick on color bar, small or large space) from the panel. Also, user can drag these small boxes on the plot to get preferred layout and save it as high resolution SVG figure. 

In addition, when you hover over mouse on a box, you can get detailed information about the source and target of flow

![Sankey diagram provides quick and easy way to explore the inter-dependent relationship of variables.](figures/F16.jpg)

## VIP	– Stacked	Barplot
To show the distribution of cells among categories of an annotation and/or ranges of expression of agene. Only two factors from annotations or genes can be chosen. The plot allows user to explore the distribution of cells in different views interactively.

![The distribution of cells in the selected group(s) regarding categories of an annotation and expression ranges of a gene](figures/F17A.jpg)

![Expand view to show percentage instead of numbers of cells](figures/F17B.jpg)

![Mouse over a bar to show details. Y-axis is re-located for better view and the number of cells represented by the bar is also shown in legend.](figures/F17C.jpg)

## VIP	– Gene	Detected
To show the number of genes expressed above the specified expression cut-off in the selected group(s) of cells.

![The number of genes with expression over the cut-off in the cells from the selected group(s) of cells](figures/F18.jpg)

## VIP	– DEG	(Differential	Expressed	Genes)
Besides plotting functions, cellxgene VIP also provides differential analysis between two selected groups of cells to identify differential expressed genes. 

Three differential analysis statistical test methods are provided including Welch’s t-test, Wilcoxon rank test and Wald’s test. The statistical test results are presented in a table format including log2 Fold change, p-value and padj value (i.e, FDR value). Please note, we provide users with simple test methods for quick exploration within the interactive framework. However, there would be covariates need to be considered in a proper statistical test. Please consult your stats experts for appropriate test by using the right test method and right model.

Volcano plotting is also provided to show the log2FC vs. -log10(FDR) relationship for all genes. User can select the gene(s) from the pre-selected gene list to be highlighted with text in the volcano plot.

![DEG analysis between the selected group(s)](figures/F19A.jpg)

![Volcano plotting of identified DEGs.](figures/F19B.jpg)

Note: The data used by DEG is unscaled (please refer to description of the dataset to find out what preprocessing was done on the data). Scaling control in the Figure Option does not apply to DEG. The three methods: ‘Welch’s t-test’ uses t-test (assuming underlining data with normal distributions) this uses cellxgene t-test implementation, ‘Wilcoxon rank test’ uses Wilcoxon rank-sum test (does not assume known distributions, non-parametric test) and ‘Wald’s test’ uses Wald Chi-Squared test which is based on maximum likelihood. ‘Wilcoxon rank test’ and ‘Wald’s test’ use diffxpy’s implementation.

## VIP	– Marker	Genes
This functional module allows user to identify marker genes in the selected group(s) (more than 2, if 2 groups, please use DEG) of cells by annotation categories.

Four methods are provided for detecting marker genes including logreg, t-test, Wilcoxon, and t422 testoverest_var. For each identified marker gene, the gene name, scores (the z-score underlying the computation of a p-value for each gene for each group) and assigned group are listed in the output table.

In each annotation category, top ranked marker genes (this example shows top 2) will be plotted by score in comparison to the rest of the categories.

![Marker genes detection in the selected group(s) of cells regarding to the selected annotation categories](figures/F20A.jpg)

![Plotting of identified marker genes by each category](figures/F20B.jpg)

Note: The four methods implementations by calling scanpy.tl.rank_genes_groups function: 'logreg' uses logistic regression, 't-test' uses t-test, 'wilcoxon' uses Wilcoxon rank-sum, and ‘t-test_overestim_var’ overestimates variance of each group.

## VIP	– Command	Line	Interface
Although cellxgene VIP provides a rich set of visualization modules as shown above, command line interface is also built to allow unlimited visualization and analytical capabilities by power user who know how to program in Python / R languages. 


![Command line interface for user to program for advanced plotting and statistical analysis.](figures/F21.jpg)

Note: In CLI the AnnData (adata) object is available by default, and it is processed as ‘Description’ of the dataset states (i.e.: normalized and log transformed, but no scaled etc.). Settings in ‘Figure Option’ tab won’t apply to CLI.

##  VIP	– Comb.	&	Abbr.

User can combine multiple annotations to create combinatorial annotation to group cells in various of plotting, e.g., stacked violin and dot plot. Firstly, user ‘uncheck all annotations’ and, secondly go to the annotation panel in main window to select annotation categories to be combined, e.g., diagnosis (Control and MS) combined with sex (female and male). After clicking on ‘Create’ button, all possible combinatorial names will be listed and ‘Custom_combine’ will be automatically available as an option in ‘Group by’ drop down menu of many plotting functions.

User can also rename each annotation by creating abbreviations to shorten axis labels in figures.

![Comb. & Abbr. function allows user to create new annotation by combining multiple annotations and abbreviations to shorten axis labels in figures especially when custom combinatorial names are used](figures/F22.jpg)

## VIP	– Other	Functions

There are other convenient functions available to user, such as ‘Save’ or ‘Load’ session, ‘Check All Annotations’ and ‘Brush’.

‘Save’ or ‘Load’ session are used to save the current cell selections and parameter settings to text file or load previously saved session file in the tool for visualization.

‘Check All Annotations’ is used to check all categorical selection boxes of annotations on the left panel.

‘Brush’ is to display exactly these selected ranges from histograms of variables on the right panel in a nice table that is not available in original cellxgene.

![Other functions allow user to ‘Save’ or ‘Load’ session information, ‘Check All Annotations’ and show values of brushed ranges on histograms](figures/F23.jpg)

# Methods

## Client-side	Integration	by	a	jsPanel	Window	(VIP) {-}
Following section in config.sh file.

(NEED sh code)

All functional VIP HTML and JavaScript code will be in “interface.html” that is independent of cellxgene code bases.

## Server-side	Integration {-}
Following section in config.sh file.
(NEED sh code)

## Communication	between	VIP	and	cellxgene	web	GUI {-}
Cellxgene client utilizes React Redux that is the official React binding for Redux. It lets your React components read data from a Redux store, and dispatch actions to the store to update data.

So, this line of code is appended to the end of client/src/reducers/index.js of cellxgene source code to expose the store to the browser.
```{bash}
window.store = store;
```

By doing this, Redux store holding client data and user selections are visible to VIP to access variables and dispatch actions to control cellxgene user interface. For example,

- Unselect / select a feature. GUI is refreshed automatically after dispatching.
```{bash}
windows.
```

- Get state of just finished action and synchronize gene input and cell selections from main window to VIP if corresponding action was performed.
```{bash}
const unscribte = window
```

## Diffxpy	Integration {-}
This is the sample pseudocode, please see VIPInterface.py for actual implementation.
```{python}
import scanpy as sc
```

## Create	h5ad	file	from	Seurat	object
First, export the following from Seurat object in R: expression matrix (assume normalized), metadata and coordinates (pca, tsne, umap) as separate txt files.

Next in Python, create an AnnData object from 10x (scanpy.read_h5ad function) as a starting point. Then replace the expression matrix, meta data and coordinates as following, a h5ad file would be generated.

```{python}
import sys

```


<!--chapter:end:03-Methods.Rmd-->

# Helpful Tips

## Handle	nulls	in	categorical	annotation
Such nan’s in categorical annotation would cause trouble in VIP because it cannot be converted to string. Here is how to handle it, let’s call the annotation X_annotation:
```{python}
ada.obs = 
```

## Display	full	traceback	stack	for	debugging	in	VIP
It follows the global setting. Please set “—verbose” to launch cellxgene server. 

## Pitfall	of	using	special	characters
In the mode which allows user to create manual annotation in cellxgene, user should try to avoid using hyphen (“-”) in name label.It would cause client-side issue. Please try to use underscores.

## Potential	use	for	bulk	or	pseudo	bulk	sample	dataset
Once the data matrix is replaced by sample x gene matrix, cellxgene VIP framework can handle regular bulk / pseudobulk RNAseq datasets. Simply replace “cells” by “samples”. All plotting functions would still work.
